ba03ec24-f10e-4925-aa48-9ea4e4bb1d70
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.270
United States and Canada.

2f01e205-852c-4da5-b324-707b48e5f5e7
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.480
Story of the surfer picture.

fdb3d896-fc9c-45f3-ad38-6575ae9fb052
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.020
 I’m from California. There were surfers there and there are surfers here. A little illogical, but they’re in the United States. 

2696e489-d4bb-4fec-9f32-6e467fbddbd8
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.090
And people say if there are surfers there then why are you here? 

d1171dfe-5184-43ec-ae07-1d6016d67a73
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.590
Well, I don’t need a wetsuit.

a92357a1-0ce3-4135-a112-b55a2f9204f2
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.180
Ok. North American cultural contributions.

95d7cd8c-4a72-47c9-9369-edd2bd70d2e8
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.380
So I was playing with the toys when you came in. 

25b8531d-388a-4fa9-a6fe-7a769e2d3805
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:07.470
If I were to pick something to play that people would truly consider American, I would… what band music would I play?

db890159-6110-4b46-9185-9fa013b7b636
00:01:7.470 --> 00:01:13.280
Jazz. That is one of the things that make us very American.

03b9ecd8-4ca9-4be2-a53b-fd57fb4ee41f
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.890
Jazz is a mix. What you need to know, take a guess. It’s a mix of two different musical traditions.

47ff9e9b-27f2-4f7d-a1d7-53d12dbd69da
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.770
Where might one of these traditions be from? 

d39bbab7-7d83-4cce-a6ad-baa1595138c9
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:36.270
Absolutely. So Africa absolutely because you have your founders slave culture there. And Spain, yes, but we get even bigger… 

40852736-d4e0-4c78-b77c-1427cbea05ab
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.850
Spain’s part of…? Europe! Yes. 

a3aef092-7923-4d3a-8d80-15a2cf57a502
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.870
And definitely you have some of jazz coming from that too in Europe.

02b89ecf-1118-4ac3-843d-a388415c1845
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.600
So jazz is a mixture of African heritage and European classical.

fc96f1ab-a672-4dd2-ac81-9bc6323f261f
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.600
Spain would fit into that plus some of the other traditions. 

ba0d67f8-2cfe-452f-97cf-5b40e97883b5
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:07.500
And now it is quintessentially American, which already says so much because it is from traditions and peoples that are not of this land.

6c7116c1-cd7b-415b-b3b9-40749a2bda93
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Theirs becomes ours and that’s how we get a lot of things here. 

fb24199a-a82c-44cd-bace-6e50aafe1cd5
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.500
So, alright. 

895e81ff-a017-45d7-9ea1-5dc82608bbb7
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.500
You can see, this is a picture of the United States. And I tried to cut off this line, but keep this really important state. 

e59d4b4c-4d3e-47d4-b540-30c9c504562d
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.500
What I have cut off here is Mexico. Some people would call that north America.

f4e51e07-b2c2-4f11-84e7-c9b07021a059
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.500
Depending on how you feel about it, it’s really latin America. So really we will talk about that next week.

c4cffd06-a6fd-4760-88af-d3ac0dea3d0f
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Ok. 48 contiguous states. And everyone says ‘oh I learned that in 6th grade.’ 

15b59f7c-2904-4617-a38a-f4c76216d907
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.500
Contiguous. What does that mean? Contiguous. Yes! 

b52d913a-a2de-4853-ad24-37105787efdf
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
That they’re next to each other. They’re connected to each other.

8c198d8e-cc53-43c9-a337-9be3de741692
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
We have 48 contiguous states, but we know that we have more than that.

4ec9ebbd-a88b-48dd-b774-18069ab3ba12
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.500
We have two non-contiguous states. What and what? 

dd04c551-a1ae-4ffb-90a8-fa749abe25e1
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Alaska and… Hawaii. Wonder how we got them

59caec9d-fb7b-4fc8-95eb-137471f36e2b
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.500
Alright. Canada. Canada is big. And that’s actually important.

24f5c994-ef8a-4389-bf30-9c2d5f284beb
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.500
We thought the Russian Federation was huge, well second to that is Canada.

174006a6-4b23-4a19-8643-5f7d2fedf5c5
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.500
So this is important. Important part of the world and an important part of our connection. 

a362f815-4e17-45ae-88c3-7719a7c68ca4
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.500
So north America, in the way, way north we go up into the Arctic.

97e6b2e2-c0db-454f-b804-9e36b79b0890
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:56.500
I have a picture of Alaska here. Obviously this is out of my hotel, and it’s not a really nice hotel.

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.500
I had taken this picture at 11 o’clock and this continues to fascinate me. Is this 11 am or pm? 

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.500
Pm! And… I just… that just trips me out. 

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.500
So I’m here winter or summer? Summer. Very much in summer.

59caec9d-fb7b-4fc8-95eb-137471f36e2b
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500
Winter, it would be dark for most of the time. 

24f5c994-ef8a-4389-bf30-9c2d5f284beb
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:32.500
And also, again, the span of this area we’re talking about goes all the way down to the south. Subtropical.

174006a6-4b23-4a19-8643-5f7d2fedf5c5
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.500
What is the most subtropical place in the United States? Florida.

a362f815-4e17-45ae-88c3-7719a7c68ca4
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:48.500
Yes, and actually somebody said Hawaii, which actually wasn’t terrible but they’re actually sort of tropical.

97e6b2e2-c0db-454f-b804-9e36b79b0890
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.500
Ok. So when we’re talking about Canada and the United States, common physical resources.

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.500
We have minerals. Fisheries. This is not my picture. 

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.500
I was in Alaska and I was very excited. Oh I’m going to stand on a bridge and see… what were they waiting for?

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.500
Salmon. It was going to be so cool and I looked over and was going to take a picture and I waited and… nothing.

59caec9d-fb7b-4fc8-95eb-137471f36e2b
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.500
So I got this fine individual. Fertile land. 

24f5c994-ef8a-4389-bf30-9c2d5f284beb
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.500
A lot of farming. Most of it looks like this. 

174006a6-4b23-4a19-8643-5f7d2fedf5c5
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:36.500
Forests. Kind of interesting since both places have forests, but none of the textbooks discuss this. Wildlife.  

a362f815-4e17-45ae-88c3-7719a7c68ca4
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.500
Ah! Not my picture.

97e6b2e2-c0db-454f-b804-9e36b79b0890
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:48.500
But that, with the little black blob… that’s my picture. (Student: Black bear?) yes. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.500
It is a black bear. Who has seen a bear? 

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.500
Yes you all are way ahead of all of us.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.500
So we see this black blob and we’re driving on and I’m like ‘oh! This is so exciting!’ and we get out and the bear is trundling off. 

59caec9d-fb7b-4fc8-95eb-137471f36e2b
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:18.500
And we see it sitting, and it’s eating berries. And it’s just… when you see a bear and you see an animal in the wild just doing its thing… it’s just… really incredible. 

24f5c994-ef8a-4389-bf30-9c2d5f284beb
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:25.500
So we went and we took the picture. And it was our first night in. 

174006a6-4b23-4a19-8643-5f7d2fedf5c5
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.500
And they said, “oh well did you hear about the hiker? Yesterday he was killed and eaten by a bear.” 

a362f815-4e17-45ae-88c3-7719a7c68ca4
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Maybe not a black bear, but a grizzly. 

97e6b2e2-c0db-454f-b804-9e36b79b0890
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500
And they said “yeah a black bear”. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500
Oh. Who’s seen ‘The Revenant’?  

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:52.500
ok, I gotta be honest, but there’s a bear scene and that made me more worried than I was. 

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:00.500
So, I went out the next morning and I went for my little jog. And I feel very clever and I [inaudible]. 

59caec9d-fb7b-4fc8-95eb-137471f36e2b
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.500
And it’s even got the little maple leaves because it’s Canada

24f5c994-ef8a-4389-bf30-9c2d5f284beb
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:22.500
So, I’m going out for my run, and [inaudible]. So I’m going for my run, and I walk into a bear. 

174006a6-4b23-4a19-8643-5f7d2fedf5c5
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.500
And I’m here and they’re about where you guys are there. 

a362f815-4e17-45ae-88c3-7719a7c68ca4
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:36.500
And all I can think of is ‘I can’t outrun a bear’. 

97e6b2e2-c0db-454f-b804-9e36b79b0890
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:48.500
So I just back up slowly and there’s a little river creek thing. And I’m thinking I will go to the water, and then the bear won’t get me.

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:57.500
A bear is afraid of water? And then I was like, ‘wait no. that’s a bad idea.’  

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.500
And then I thought act big and act scary! 

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:13.500
So I’m looking at the bear and I go *roar* 

59caec9d-fb7b-4fc8-95eb-137471f36e2b
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:20.500
And you know how animals do that thing where they just cock their head? 

24f5c994-ef8a-4389-bf30-9c2d5f284beb
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:35.500
And then I got scared and thought it was going to eat me. And then I just [inaudible].

174006a6-4b23-4a19-8643-5f7d2fedf5c5
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:48.500
So I’m looking at it and I just *noise*. And it just looks at me and it just walked off.  

a362f815-4e17-45ae-88c3-7719a7c68ca4
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:55.500
(Student: inaudible) Well, that’s probably another thing I should’ve done. 

97e6b2e2-c0db-454f-b804-9e36b79b0890
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:07.500
So now I have to decide what to do. Do I go back? Do I go forward? And I *shakes bells*. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.500
And you’re supposed to let the bear know you are coming.  

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.500
And if it knows you are coming, it is not supposed to be interested in you.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:30.500
It’s when you shock it that it has a tendency to eat you. So that’s my bear experience. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:44.500
Bighorn sheep. I remember driving in the car and I said, ‘oh I want to get a picture.’ 

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.500
And they started coming into the window. And I said “ooo! I can take a picture!”.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:57.500
Another thing that they say we have in common is physical beauty, which always makes me laugh. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.500
But that’s something that we have in common. 

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.500
This top left is Alaska on a train ride going up into the mountains and it’s beautiful.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:14.500
And Canada, again, it is truly, truly beautiful landscape. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:24.500
Ok. Another thing that we do well in the United States and Canada is we use our technology to exploit our sources.  

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.500
So one example of that would be going down the Mississippi river.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:42.500
This is a big river, but what did we build? (Student: canals?) Canals and… levees! 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:55.500
Now the reason why is that the Mississippi river is a meandering river. So a meandering river moves like this.  

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.500
So it will go this way, and then this way. Ok so it’s not straight.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:06.500
So a meandering river, what it does, is it changes its course. The way a river flows, the outside part is faster. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.500
So it manages just to cut out further, so the whole thing will start to move over.

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:20.500
So you have this moving river, and you want your towns to be nearest to water. And people settle near the river.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:28.500
Now, everyone is excited. “We got that river front, yay!” and now the river is going to come and wipe out and ugh. 

599ab100-3eb5-49aa-ad65-94fae220c1a0
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:35.500
So they built the levees. We are controlling our resources. We are using our technology to control it.  

20c55f10-d937-4337-946e-8e2432508a60
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.500
So you can have the river, you can be close to it, but the river doesn’t wipe you out. It doesn’t do it’s natural course.  

60f551ed-aff0-488c-af75-1150d91b0ec9
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Now, clearly we do what we can. Katrina. What happened to those levees? They broke!
