1
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,270
United States and Canada

2
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,480
Story of the surfer picture

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,020
I'm from California. There were surfers there and there are surfers here.

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,020
A little illogical, but they're in the United States. 

5
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,090
And people say if there are surfers there then why are you here?

6
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,590
Well, I don't need a wetsuit

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,180
Ok. North American cultural contributions

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,380
So I was playing with the toys when you came in.

9
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:05,470
If I were to pick something to play that people would truly consider American

10
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,470
 I would' what band music would I play

11
00:01:7,470 --> 00:01:13,280
Jazz. That is one of the things that make us very American

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,890
Jazz is a mix. What you need to know, take a guess

13
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,890
It's a mix of two different musical traditions

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,770
Where might one of these traditions be from?

15
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,270
Absolutely. So Africa absolutely because you have your founders slave culture there.

16
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,270
And Spain, yes, but we get even bigger'

17
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,850
Spain's part of'? Europe! Yes.

18
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,870
And definitely you have some of jazz coming from that too in Europe

19
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:53,600
So jazz is a mixture of African heritage and European classical

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Spain would fit into that plus some of the other traditions.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,500
And now it is quintessentially American, which already says so much becaus

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,500
it is from traditions and peoples that are not of this land

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Theirs becomes ours and that's how we get a lot of things here.

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
So, alright.

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
You can see, this is a picture of the United States

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
And I tried to cut off this line, but keep this really important state.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
What I have cut off here is Mexico. Some people would call that north America

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Depending on how you feel about it, it's really latin America

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
So really we will talk about that next week

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Ok. 48 contiguous states. And everyone says 'oh I learned that in 6th grade.'

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Contiguous. What does that mean? Contiguous. Yes!

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
That they're next to each other. They're connected to each other

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
We have 48 contiguous states, but we know that we have more than that

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
We have two non-contiguous states. What and what?

35
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Alaska and' Hawaii. Wonder how we got the

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Alright. Canada. Canada is big. And that's actually important

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
We thought the Russian Federation was huge, well second to that is Canada

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
So this is important.

39
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Important part of the world and an important part of our connection.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,500
So north America, in the way, way north we go up into the Arctic

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,500
I have a picture of Alaska here

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Obviously this is out of my hotel, and it's not a really nice hotel

43
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I had taken this picture at 11 o'clock and this continues to fascinate me

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Is this 11 am or pm

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Pm! And' I just' that just trips me out.

46
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,500
So I'm here winter or summer? Summer. Very much in summer

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Winter, it would be dark for most of the time.

48
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
And also, again

49
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,500
the span of this area we're talking about goes all the way down to the south

50
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Subtropical

51
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
What is the most subtropical place in the United States? Florida

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Yes, and actually somebody said Hawaii

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,500
which actually wasn't terrible but they're actually sort of tropical

54
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Ok. So when we're talking about Canada and the United States

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
common physical resources

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,500
We have minerals. Fisheries. This is not my picture.

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I was in Alaska and I was very excited

58
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Oh I'm going to stand on a bridge and see' what were they waiting for

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Salmon. It was going to be so cool and I looked ove

60
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,500
and was going to take a picture and I waited and' nothing

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,500
So I got this fine individual. Fertile land.

62
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,500
A lot of farming. Most of it looks like this.

63
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Forests. Kind of interesting since both places have forests

64
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,500
but none of the textbooks discuss this. Wildlife. 

65
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Ah! Not my picture

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,500
But that, with the little black blob' that's my picture

67
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Student: Black bear?) yes

68
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
It is a black bear. Who has seen a bear?

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Yes you all are way ahead of all of us. 

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,500
So we see this black blob and we're driving on and I'm like 'oh! This is so exciting!

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
and we get out and the bear is trundling off

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
And we see it sitting, and it's eating berries. And it's just

73
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:15,500
when you see a bear and you see an animal in the wild just doing its thing

74
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
it's just' really incredible

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,500
So we went and we took the picture. And it was our first night in.

76
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
And they said, 'oh well did you hear about the hiker

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Yesterday he was killed and eaten by a bear.'

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Maybe not a black bear, but a grizzly.

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
And they said 'yeah a black bear'.

80
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Oh. Who's seen 'The Revenant'? 

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:52,500
ok, I gotta be honest, but there's a bear scene and that made me more worried than I was.

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,500
So, I went out the next morning and I went for my little jog.

83
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
And I feel very clever and I [inaudible].

84
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,500
And it's even got the little maple leaves because it's Canad

85
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:22,500
So, I'm going out for my run, and [inaudible]. So I'm going for my run, and I walk into a bear.

86
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:30,500
And I'm here and they're about where you guys are there.

87
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And all I can think of is 'I can't outrun a bear'.

88
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,500
So I just back up slowly and there's a little river creek thing

89
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,500
And I'm thinking I will go to the water, and then the bear won't get me

90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:57,500
A bear is afraid of water? And then I was like, 'wait no. that's a bad idea.' 

91
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,500
And then I thought act big and act scary!

92
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:13,500
So I'm looking at the bear and I go *roar*

93
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,500
And you know how animals do that thing where they just cock their head?

94
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:35,500
And then I got scared and thought it was going to eat me. And then I just [inaudible]

95
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:48,500
So I'm looking at it and I just *noise*. And it just looks at me and it just walked off. 

96
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,500
(Student: inaudible) Well, that's probably another thing I should've done.

97
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:07,500
So now I have to decide what to do. Do I go back? Do I go forward? And I *shakes bells*.

98
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,500
And you're supposed to let the bear know you are coming. 

99
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,500
And if it knows you are coming, it is not supposed to be interested in you. 

100
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:30,500
It's when you shock it that it has a tendency to eat you. So that's my bear experience.

101
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Bighorn sheep. I remember driving in the car and I said, 'oh I want to get a picture.'

102
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,500
And they started coming into the window. And I said 'ooo! I can take a picture!'. 

103
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Another thing that they say we have in common is physical beauty, which always makes me laugh.

104
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,500
But that's something that we have in common.

105
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,500
This top left is Alaska on a train ride going up into the mountains and it's beautiful. 

106
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,500
And Canada, again, it is truly, truly beautiful landscape.

107
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Ok. Another thing that we do well in the United States and Canada is we use our technology to exploit our sources. 

108
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
So one example of that would be going down the Mississippi river. 

109
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:42,500
This is a big river, but what did we build? (Student: canals?) Canals and' levees!

110
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Now the reason why is that the Mississippi river is a meandering river

111
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
So a meandering river moves like this.

112
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
So it will go this way, and then this way. Ok so it's not straight. 

113
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,500
So a meandering river, what it does, is it changes its course

114
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
The way a river flows, the outside part is faster.

115
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,500
So it manages just to cut out further, so the whole thing will start to move over

116
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,500
So you have this moving river, and you want your towns to be nearest to water

117
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
And people settle near the river. 

118
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Now, everyone is excited.

119
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,500
'We got that river front, yay!' and now the river is going to come and wipe out and ugh.

120
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
So they built the levees. We are controlling our resources

121
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
We are using our technology to control it

122
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,500
So you can have the river, you can be close to it, but the river doesn't wipe you out

123
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
It doesn't do it's natural course.

124
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Now, clearly we do what we can. Katrina. What happened to those levees? They broke!

125
00:11:51,500 --> 00:12:04,500
So again, we do what we can to control nature. But at some point, there is only so much we can do

126
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
With Katrina the levee broke, and [inaudible].

127
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:14,500
So some of the results of this are a really high standard of living in both of these places. 

128
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Here's a picture of Vancouver. Some people have been to Vancouver, it's a beautiful city.

129
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,500
And as a result, they get a lot of pollution.

130
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:33,500
That picture, that I took from California, I'm from northern California. 

131
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:42,500
This is from somewhere in California famous for their smog. What city is this? Los Angeles.

132
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:59,500
That's Los Angeles [inaudible].
